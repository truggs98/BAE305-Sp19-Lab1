# Lab 1 - Well-Equipped

# By: Thomas Ruggles, Tyler Nichols, Amelia Bolin
# Summary
Lab goal; summary of work performed; summary of outcome
Lab 1 will be somewhat different since this is an introduction to the equipment.
# Materials
List materials used in the lab (not the testing equipment, but that used to build the lab project)
# Assembly Procedures
Provide basic summary of steps performed in lab (Do not copy and paste from lab assignment.) The important part here is to provide detail that you had to develop in the lab which will be more important in later labs.
You must include Schematics, Engineering Drawings, and Programming if appropriate in this section.
1. This is step 1.
2. This is step 2.
3. This is step 3.
I am now including an image as an example:

# Discussion
Did you make any design decisions that had an impact on the results? How did they impact the results? What do the results mean?

All the measured resistor values from part a fell within the given acceptable ranges, as did all capacitors in part b. For each channel in part c, all meaused voltages were within .15 V of the expected voltage. In part d, all of our measurement methods gave fairly accurate amplitude values, except with the generic DMM which gave a low reading. All frequency values in part d were within .2 Hz of each other, except the value obtained "counting squares", which was slightly high. Since most of our readings gave accurate results that fell within the expected ranges, we can assume the components we were measuring was produced correctly and can be used in a circuit. 
This lab allowed us to get a solid understanding of the equipment we will be working with this semester. We were able to practice meausring equipment as well as become more familiar with machines like the function generator and oscilloscope. The oscilloscope did give us some issues duirng our lab but it was mostly due to our unfamiliarity with the controls.
