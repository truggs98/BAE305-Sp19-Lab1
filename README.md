# Lab 1 - Well-Equipped

# By: Joe Dvorak
# Summary
Lab goal; summary of work performed; summary of outcome
Lab 1 will be somewhat different since this is an introduction to the equipment.
# Materials
List materials used in the lab (not the testing equipment, but that used to build the lab project)
# Assembly Procedures
Provide basic summary of steps performed in lab (Do not copy and paste from lab assignment.) The important part here is to provide detail that you had to develop in the lab which will be more important in later labs.
You must include Schematics, Engineering Drawings, and Programming if appropriate in this section.
1. This is step 1.
2. This is step 2.
3. This is step 3.
I am now including an image as an example:
